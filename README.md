# Pandemic Simulator



PyLogo is a Python implementation of elements of [NetLogo](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/), made by https://github.com/RussAbbott/PyLogo.

PyLogo uses [_pygame_](https://www.pygame.org/docs/) and [_pySimpleGui_](https://pysimplegui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), two very nice libraries. It also makes minimal use of [_NumPy_](https://numpy.org/). All three libraries must be installed.
